`Project Pitch: `
People visiting the site will gain a better understanding of the refugee crisis and what it means to be a refugee. There are more people displaced in the world today than at any time since the end of World War II and it is more important than ever to help people develop empathy for each other. 

`MVP: `
As an admin I can log in and approve or reject submitted stories. As a refugee I can come to the site and submit my story without logging in. 

`MVP Breakdown: `
There are designs that showed how the website should look like.
Web UI has a marketing landing page that is responsive and shows an example of what the site is about. Web Frontend has a deployed website that has working links, features a page that pulls from a database for refugee stories, and features a different page where stories can be submitted to the database. The database used by the frontend is also deployed and successfully interacts with the frontend.
